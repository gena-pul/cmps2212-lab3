Lab 3 – The this Keyword & DOM Manipulation

This lab explores how the this keyword works in JavaScript event handlers.

It includes four exercises:

    Exercise 1: Multi-Button Highlight using this

    Exercise 2: Reading data-* attributes with this.dataset

    Exercise 3: Counter App using .bind() to preserve object context

    Exercise 4: Fixing an arrow function bug using event.currentTarget

Each exercise was completed in its own Git branch (exercise-1 through 
exercise-4) and merged into main.
